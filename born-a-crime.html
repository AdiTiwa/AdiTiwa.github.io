                    <p class="writing-content">
                        &emsp;The theme of the book “Born a Crime” is about how you can overcome challenges to change your circumstance no matter the place that you come from. This is mainly developed through the depiction of the setting around Trevor Noah and his outcome currently in the world outside of the book. All of the information in the book helps to develop the theme, no matter the story it is part of. Take for example, one of the larger overarching stories that develop the theme, or the story pertaining to the development of Trevor's position in society.<br>
                        &emsp;First- a quick summary of the events in the Noah household, due to their household being the setting for a mass amount of the story throughout the novel. The first information notable to the story is when Trevor is born to racially mixed parents, which at the time was not considered legal so their parents were kept apart and thus Trevor was raised by his single mother. Then his mother eventually got a boyfriend, who Trevor was supported right up until they wanted to get married. He was not supportive of his decision due to the boyfriend's rage, nevertheless his mother and the boyfriend (Abel) got married and as such he and his step-father had not-so-great relationships their entire life. This all culminates in multiple disagreements through their lives together, leading up to the story finale; when Trevor’s mother is shot by his step-father in a fit of drunken rage. <br>
                        &emsp;As described, the environment that he was brought up in was not the greatest. However, as of today, he is in a much great spot career and family-wise. All of these changes in his life were indicated by many points in the story. In total, all the quotes develop the theme of overcoming challenges. One of the first instances of showing change is when he realized how his legally questionable actions he had done in the “hood” affected others, in which he developed a conscience about the normal actions that many people would take at the time in South Africa. In chapter 15 he realized "there were people on the other end of this thing that I was doing, and what I was doing was wrong.” showing his remorse for his actions at the time, and how he had changed learning about the extreme poverty-ridden “hood”. However, that was only a half step towards his position today as a comedian. He addressed his career right at the end of the book when his mother was shot. “I was off becoming a comedian, touring the country, playing shows in England, hosting radio shows, hosting television shows,” he said plainly. This, though a quickly mentioned fact, eludes to his current career in stand-up comedy, and how he currently lives in the furthest place from the poverty that had plagued him before. In total, the childhood of Trevor Noah setup the initial setting of the book, and through small changes through the part of his life that he chronicled; he changed his own position in society, overcoming the challenges that his race and his childhood had left him.<br>
                        &emsp;This evolution of Trevor’s position and conscience was one of the many stories that have the story's theme found in them. They all emphasize the initial setting and the journey to the ultimate ending in an attempt to show an improvement. And with this pattern, the book gives examples to the reader that anyone can get themselves out of any situation no matter the difficulty.

                            <p class="quote">“...crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn’t do: crime
                                cares.”</p>

                                &emsp; This quote, taken when Trevor was reflecting on his observations about society from where he came from in the hood. He was explaining the importance of crime in his community and how society had crime as an essential counter to the corrupt government at the time. But this line allows the reader to empathize with the people in South Africa since crime is antagonized to the modern world, though at the time in South Africa it was considered a necessary action for many. Therefore, instead of the reader antagonizing the people of South Africa, they can understand that crime was the only facet for many and that it can be excused to some degree.

                            <p class="writing-content">
                                &emsp; This quote, take from a monologue after Trevor finds out that he may be put into what is called the black tax or the cycle of poverty that is prominent in South Africa at the time, shows that even if someone is as famous as he was, the people are still subject to the effects of life in South Africa. This revelation occurred when his mother was shot and he was about to pay for her hospital bills. The black tax was described as a process of violence and debt that his family was well acquainted with. This, with the descriptions of his actions, just before he had come to South Africa to meet his mother, shows that even those that would usually be considered as rich may have to face the fears of a poor man, just due to their past or skin color. And since the reader knows that his mother was considered a very important part of his life for Trevor, this extenuates the importance of this one moment.
