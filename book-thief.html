                        &emsp;The story of “The Book Thief” is mainly about the protagonist of the story, Liesel Meminger, and how she grew and
                        changed throughout her experiences in the now destroyed Nazi Germany. A theme that is prevalent through the duration of
                        “The Book Thief” is the effect of anger and abandonment to create change, negative or positive. The story has many
                        instances where a character experiences anger or feels abandoned through their dialogue and actions, including Liesel
                        herself- usually leading to a change in the character’s motivations or biases. <br>
                        &emsp; The first appearance of the theme is when Liesel lost her brother and her mother was taken away due to her being a
                        communist, in which she feels both angry and feels like her family has abandoned her. She responds to this blatantly in
                        the prologue when <i class="writing-important">“She knelt. The Book Thief howled.” (page 14-
                        prologue)</i> in response to her brother dying. This was introduced as early as the prologue and the resentment did not stop for the
                        protagonist of the story. However, the largest display of anger and abandonment was found late in the story, during the
                        book burning festival. The festival took place on pages 108 to 122 in part 2, “the shoulder shrug”. After the bonfire is
                        complete, and Liesel is talking about what she had heard during the festival, she realizes what communism is and what
                        may have had to her biological mother. In reaction to this realization, the story recounts: <i
                        class="writing-important">“‘I hate the Fuhrer,’ she said. ‘I hate him.’”(page 155, the shoulder shrug)</i>. This
                        moment changes Liesel’s perspective on the Nazi Party since, after this moment, she becomes more apprehensive of the
                        actions of Nazi Germany. <br>
                        &emsp; All in all, the theme that the book thief develops is that anger and abandonment can lead to change or the changing of
                        one’s perspective. The theme is developed through the characters adapting to their environment after showing their anger
                        or resentment towards an action or group and changing their actions or biases against that group or thought.

                                &emsp; “The Book Thief” was written from the perspective of a personified Death, which makes more sense to the
                                reader
                                later on
                                as the book reveals its more morbid events. However, through all of these events, death is developed as a person
                                as a
                                character may be. But the larger undertaking was introducing the narrator in an interesting way without
                                confusing the
                                reader and also leaving the book to interpretation, therefore leaving the reader with the option to infer about
                                the
                                narrator right out the gate or ignore the identity storyteller until it is nearly explicitly told and the
                                identity
                                becomes necessary to a full understanding of the story. One of the first lines in the book is Death making a
                                statement;
                                <i class="writing-important">“Here’s a small fact- You are going to die.” (page 3- prologue)</i>. Immediately,
                                even if the reader is not sure who
                                the
                                narrator is going to be, it heavily insinuates someone who is close to the concept of death. However, nearly
                                immediately
                                after he says <i class="writing-important">“Reaction to the aforementioned fact; Does this worry you? I urge
                                    you- don’t be afraid. I’m nothing but
                                    fair.” (page 3- prologue)</i>. This explanation almost seems like Death himself was consoling people that he
                                has to
                                eventually deal with, and the quote confirms that by referring to the past sentences and using personal pronouns
                                with
                                commonly used phrases to replace the idea Death with a pronoun.
                                <br>
                                &emsp; However, this can be missed by not-so-avid readers. As a result, some parts of the story may be left
                                underdeveloped and
                                may not make sense without the information that Death is telling a story. But, to combat these
                                misunderstandings, the
                                author writes about an event a handful of times, since each event is individually important to the story. Thus,
                                even if
                                the reader were to miss all of the hints that elude the real identity of the storyteller, the events will get
                                clarified
                                in the story. The result of such clarifications leads to a slightly underdeveloped story, though arguably
                                complete
                                story. However, most readers read the introduction as expected leading to a more interesting story where the
                                reader has
                                to consciously understand the many clues the author gives, making them into a more involved reader who has to
                                put all
                                the clues they found together to make a complete and much more meaningful, developed story.

                        &emsp;Throughout the story of “The Book Thief” the author, Marcus Zusak, writes in short, chapter-like pieces to
                        tell the
                        story. Each chapter is nearly independent, other than the characters which are carried throughout the entire
                        story. In
                        addition to the shorter chapter-like stories, the book is split into 10 different parts including the prologue
                        and
                        epilogue. In total, there are 88 chapters in the story. However, there is a problem with this sort of structure-
                        events
                        can be broken up without context to connect events to make such transitions confusing for the reader. Some parts
                        of the
                        story include large gaps of time between the last event and the current chapter’s events. These can lead to a
                        discontinued understanding of the story and the story’s parts. One example of this is the beginning of the first
                        part
                        (“the grave digger’s handbook”) in which right at the beginning of the first chapter where Death recounts the
                        story that
                        was told in the prologue, specifically when Liesel lost her brother on trying to travel to Himmel Street. Even
                        if the
                        period of time that the chapter covers is not far from the time that Liesel’s brother died, it was a break in
                        the story
                        that could have confused some readers.
                        <br>
                        &emsp; To combat such discontinuation, the author uses techniques to help the readers that may have skipped
                        important parts of
                        the story, and in this case the epilogue, since the epilogue is usually considered a non-necessary part of the
                        story. On page 20
                        (the grave digger’s handbook) Death referred to the events that were described in the epilogue, effectively
                        repeating
                        the story that was told before but faster and in a way that doesn’t require a lot of inferring due to the sheer
                        number
                        of hints provided. This is a strategy that the author used a lot throughout the story, recounting past events to
                        remind
                        the reader or to bring the reader up to speed on certain plot affecting events. Such repetitive storytelling is
                        effective here since the reader gets a shorter, more distilled version of the events when Liesel’s brother died
                        without
                        having to read the epilogue which describes the event in more detail but has more elements that are vague and
                        require
                        more inference to understand. In addition to the clues that nearly explicitly tell you the events that
                        transpired in the
                        epilogue, the reader gets new information about the plot of the current chapter since the plot can change really
                        quickly
                        if the reader doesn’t understand the last chapter’s content. In finishing, this strategy doesn’t take up much
                        time for
                        the reader however it can aid many readers that missed important details while including new information for the
                        new
                        events in the current chapter.

                        &emsp;Throughout “The Book Thief”, many people were discriminated against, due to their religion or heritage or the government

                        they were taken away and Liesel and her unnamed brother were orphaned. Such discrimination is also in effect at this
                        time, now mostly about someone’s socioeconomic position and their race and not as much about the religion that they

                        to older school systems. Also, as it seems in the story, the schools had different classes near the same way that many
                        people currently have an elementary school. However, Liesel is 12 in a good portion of the book, leading to questions
                        about eh school structure in Nazi Germany. This was probably told in the book to show how the world that Liesel lived in
                        was not as different from our world and time.

                &emsp; I, having read “The Book Thief” would rate the book 4.5/5 stars. It has a great story and has a creative cast of
                characters. I remarkably enjoyed the way that each chapter either developed the entire story or shot off in another
                direction, leading to very interesting storylines to follow. However, sometimes I am not much of a fan of the fluff off the main story. 
                Many events have near to no effect on
                the characters and the story seems to be at a standstill, though there are very minimal chapters like
                that. Overall I would recommend this book to everyone, as long as they can handle harsh language and sometimes morbid
                scenes. It is a great book specifically for those who enjoy historical fiction since it takes actual events from the time
                and mixes it into the story.
