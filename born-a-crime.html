                    <p class="writing-content">
                        &emsp;The theme of the book “Born a Crime” is about how you can overcome challenges to change your circumstance no matter the place that you come from. This is mainly developed through the depiction of the setting around Trevor Noah and his outcome currently in the world outside of the book. Nearly all of the information required is found in the main text though there are smaller examples from the text that doesn’t rely on the reader noticing the smaller text details. As such, we are going to facing one of the larger overarching examples of the theme, or the development of Trevor's position is society.<br>
                        &emsp;First- a quick summary of the events in the Noah household due to their household being the setting for a mass amount of the story throughout the novel. The first event notable to the story is when Trevor is born to racially mixed parents, which at the time was not considered legal so their parents were kept apart and thus Trevor was only raised by his mother. Then when his mother eventually got a boyfriend, Trevor was supportive right up until they wanted to get married. He was not supportive of his decision and as such he and his step-father had not-so-great relationships their entire life. This all culminates in multiple disagreements throughout their lives together, leading up to the story finale; when Trevor’s mother is shot by his step-father in a fit of drunken rage. <br>
                        &emsp;As described- the environment that he was brought up in was not the greatest. However, as of today, he is in a much great spot career and family-wise. All of these changes in his life were indicated by many points in the story. In total, all the quotes develop the theme of overcoming challenges. One of the first instances of showing change is when he changed his mind about legally questionable actions he had done in the “hood”, in which he developed a conscience about the normal actions that many people would take at the time in South Africa. In chapter 15 he realized "there were people on the other end of this thing that I was doing, and what I was doing was wrong.” showing his remorse for his actions at the time, and how he had changed after leaving the extreme poverty-ridden “hood”. However, that was only a half step towards his position today as a comedian. He addressed his career directly right at the end of the book where his mother was shot. “I was off becoming a comedian, touring the country, playing shows in England, hosting radio shows, hosting television shows,” he said plainly. This, though a quickly mentioned fact, eludes to his current career in stand-up comedy, and how he currently lives in the furthest place from the poverty that had plagued him before. <br>
                        &emsp;This evolution of Trevor’s position and conscience was one of the many stories which have the story's theme found in them. They all emphasize the initial setting and the journey to the ultimate ending, an improvement. Thus, the book gives examples to the reader that anyone can get themselves out of any situation no matter the difficulty.

                    <div class="columns">

                            <p class="quote">“...crime succeeds because crime does the one thing the government doesn’t do: crime
                                cares.”</p>
                            <p class="writing-content">
                                &emsp; This quote, taken when Trevor was reflecting on his observations about society from where he
                                came from in the hood. He
                                was explaining the importance of crime in his community and how society had crime as an essential
                                counter to the corrupt
                                government at the time. But this line allows the reader to empathize with the people in South Africa
                                since crime is
                                considered a terrible thing to the modern world, though at the time in South Africa it was
                                considered a necessary action
                                for many. Therefore, instead of the reader antagonizing the people of South Africa, they can
                                understand that crime
                                was the only facet for many and that it can be excused to some degree.

                                &emsp; This quote, take from a monologue after Trevor finds out that he may be put into what is
                                called the black tax or the
                                cycle of poverty that is prominent in South Africa at the time, shows that even if someone is as
                                famous as he was, the
                                people are still subject to racism. The black tax was described as a process of violence and debt
                                that his family was
                                well acquainted with. This, with the descriptions of his actions, just before he had come to South
                                Africa to meet his
                                mother, shows that even those that would usually be considered as rich may have to face the fears of
                                a poor man, just
                                due to their past or skin color.
